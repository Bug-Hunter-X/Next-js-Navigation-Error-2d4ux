# Next.js Navigation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where navigation links fail to work as expected. The issue lies in the way links are defined and handled in the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the home page (`http://localhost:3000`).
5. Click on the link to the About page. Observe that the link throws an error.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `Link` component from `next/link` is used correctly and that the page being navigated to exists and is properly configured in the `pages` directory.

This solution demonstrates one way to resolve the issue.  Other causes of similar errors might include incorrect routing configuration or server-side rendering problems not shown in this example.  Always consult the Next.js documentation for comprehensive troubleshooting steps.
